								  				<h1>Statistics Department </h1>
								  				<p>The Department of Mathematical Statistics was established in August 1973, though the teaching of M.A. in Mathematical Statistics had been introduced as early as in July 1957 at the initiative of Professor Ram Behari as part of a development programme adopted by the Department of Mathematics. Professor H.C. Gupta was the first head of the Department and he can be credited with the setting up of a good school in Stochastic Processes.. In 1971, the scope of post-graduate course in Mathematical Statistics was extended leading to M.Sc. degree in Statistics.
