    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <P><b>The HyperText Markup Language</b>, or <b>HTML</b> is the standard <i>markup language</i> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>It can be assisted by technologies such as <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i> (<b>CSS</b>) and scripting languages such as <b>JavaScript</b>.</P>
    <P> <i>Web browsers</i> receive HTML documents from a web server o from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</P>
        <P><i><b>HTML elements</b></i> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create <u>structured documents</u> by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <br><b>HTML</b> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. <br>
 Tags such as img / and input/ directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</P>
        <P>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as <b><i>JavaScript</i></b>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.<br> The <b><i>World Wide Web Consortium</i></b> <b>(W3C)</b>, former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational <i><b>HTML since 1997</b></i>.
        </P>
